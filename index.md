I am currently a second-year Masters student in Linguistics at North Carolina State University.

I specialize in sociophonetics with a focus in language and gender, speech perception, and phonation. I'm broadly interested in the following questions: What do we pay the most attention to when we perceive speech? Can certain socioindexical aspects of a speaker change the listener's perception of the physical sounds the speaker produces?

My research to date has focused on creaky voice and the accoustic and social effects on the perception of creaky voice versus modal voice.
