## Research Experience

* 2009-2010 - UROP Project with Carmel O'Shannessy, working on the morphology of Light Warlpiri. I coded data from a corpus and produced graphs and information regarding suffixation in Light Warlpiri. I presented a poster at the UROP Poster Session discussing my findings that a rarely-used "shortened" suffix from Warlpiri was on the rise in Light Warlpiri, due to a larger vowel inventory in English-lexified items.
* 2010 - Summer work with Marlyse Baptista. I learned how to use EndNote and taught Marlyse how to use it, as well as organizing many of her bibliographies myself. I also did several searches for literature relevant to her research in creolistics and syntax.
* 2011 – Volunteer work at Ioulia Kovelman’s Language and Literacy Lab. My work involved transcription and video linking on the Childes CLAN program. I also prepared stimuli for perception experiments.
* 2011 – Summer research work with Robin Queen. I coded comments from the Postsecret Community forums with the discourse analysis program TAMS Analyzer.
* 2012 – Work with Jon Yip. I saved production stimulus sentences from an Excel document into Photoshop images.
* 2012 – Research with Robin Queen, transcribing video clips for her book on Language and the Media.
* 2013 – Worked as an intern at the Accent Reduction Institute. Helped to create curriculum for foreign nationals learning American English pronunciation.
* 2013 – Worked with Harim Kwon, measuring Voice Onset Time in both English and Korean utterances from native Korean speakers.
