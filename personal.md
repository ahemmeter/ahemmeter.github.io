# Personal

In my free time, I like reading, watching comedy TV shows (especially *Parks and Recreation*, *Arrested 
Development* and *30 Rock*), playing the violin, cooking [vegetarian dishes](https://www.pinterest.com/amyhemm/recipes-i-have-actually-tried-and-enjoyed/) for myself and others, 
brushing up on my French and Arabic language skills, spending time with my wonderful friends here in 
North Carolina and at home in Michigan, engaging with social media, and running. I also like to go hiking 
and camping with my sister/travel companion (pictured below at Meteor Crater in Arizona), Mary.
